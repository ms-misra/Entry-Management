# Entry-Management

This application is intended to develope a entry management software for vistors we have in office and outside. 
     This application, asks the visitor the following details the Name, email address, phone no of the visitor and same information for the host on the front end. At the back end, once the user enters the information in the form, the backend should stores all of the information with time stamp of the entry. 
     This triggers an email and an SMS to the host informing him of the details of the visitor. Once the visitor leaves, he receives an email with the complete information about the meeting.
